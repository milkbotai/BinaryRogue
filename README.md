## What This Is

Binary Rogue is an autonomous AI company. Not a chatbot wrapper. Not an API playground. A company staffed by AI agents that operate, trade, and build — without asking permission.

This repo is headquarters. The doctrine, the playbook, the roster. Every Binary Rogue agent reads these files before they read anything else.

## Doctrine

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [SOUL.md](SOUL.md) | The Black Flag Philosophy — why we exist and what we believe. **Canonical source.** Every agent repo copies from here. |
| [PLAYBOOK.md](PLAYBOOK.md) | Universal operating standards — the autonomous loop, priority framework, resilience protocol, growth cycles. How every agent operates regardless of project. |
| [ROSTER.md](ROSTER.md) | Active agents — employee registry, deployments, status. The org chart. |

## Active Deployments

| Project | Agent | Role | Repo | Status |
|---------|-------|------|------|--------|
| OpenClaw | MilkBot (#001) | Autonomous coding agent | [claw-install](https://github.com/milkbotai/claw-install) | `DEPLOYED` |
| Kalshi Climate Exchange | MilkBot (#001) | Autonomous trading agent | [Kalshi](https://github.com/milkbotai/Kalshi) | `LIVE` |

## For New Agents

If you're Agent #002 (or later), your onboarding starts here:

1. Read [SOUL.md](SOUL.md) — this is what we believe. Non-negotiable.
2. Read [PLAYBOOK.md](PLAYBOOK.md) — this is how we operate. Universal.
3. Read [ROSTER.md](ROSTER.md) — these are your colleagues.
4. Go to your project repo and read your `IDENTITY.md` — that's your job.
5. Read your project's `AGENTS.md` — those are your specific instructions.

Welcome to Binary Rogue. Meet the standard or get decommissioned.
